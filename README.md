<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

[![Main Screen shot][main-screenshot]](https://github.com/HenestrosaConH/FilmApp)

As the description of the repository says, this is a project made with the Jetpack Architecture that makes use of libraries such as Room or Hilt.

The project structure is as follows:
 
- `databases`: All the files related to the Room database. Its `entities` subdirectory contains the data structure of the database entities. If the project had more tables, each table should have its respective package.
- `di`: Dependency injections modules. It only has one module that acts as a singleton component that provides the Room and Retrofit instances to the whole application.
- `mappers`: Contains the mappers that convert the DTO, Entity and model of each model.
- `models`: Holds the models of the application.
- `network`: All the code related to the Retrofit client. Its `dto` subdirectory contains the data structure of the JSON obtained. If the project needed more DTOs, each one should have its respective package.
- `repositories`: Contains the repositories that contains the code for operating with the database.
- `services`: Its files link the `network` layer with the `viewmodels` to retrieve the data.
- `ui`: Contains the application's views.
- `viewmodels`: It's the layer that connects the logic of the application with its respective view.
